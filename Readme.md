# IVD-Net: Intervertebral disc localization and segmentation in MRI with a multi-modal UNet

Repository containing the source code of the IVD-Net segmentation network that we proposed for the MICCAI 2018 IVD segmentation challenge. This architecture was used to segment the inetervertebral disc in multi-modal MRI images. Nevertheless, it can be used to segment any other structure/s in a multi-modal image setting.

## Requirements

- The code has been written in Python (3.5) and pyTorch.
- You should also have installed torchvision and scipy
